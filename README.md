# Udacity Captsone Project - Starbucks 

### Project Motivation 
This is my submission for the Udacity Data Science Capstone Project. I have been working with the Starbucks dataset to understand how offers impact customer behaviour. In this project I explore 2 avenues. First of all, does providing customers with offers impact their behaviour. The metrics I will be using to measure impact on customer behaviour are spend per transaction, and transactions per day. Seeing a rise in either of these metrics will signal a positive impact on customer behaviour. The second area of exploration will be to see which offers have the biggest impact on which customer group.

### Results
The findings, and techniques user within this project are discussed [here](https://david-bracken.medium.com/data-science-capstone-project-starbucks-dataset-76e6a4e88add)
During the Notebook there are several markdown cells discussing findings as I go, and reasoning behind decisions made. 

### Installation
All the code for this project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook. The code in this repository was created with the standard Anaconda distribution of Python. No additional libraries were utilised. There should be no issues running the code with Python versions 3.*.

### File Descriptions
 - All the source data is contained within the data file, and consists of 3 JSON files.
 - 2 additional data sources are saved as .csv files in the route directory. These are created in the code contained in the Jupyter Notebook. They are saved here as there is a lot of processing/cleaning of the data which takes a substantial amount of time. The Notebook highlights where you can skip cells where the processor intense cleaning takes place, and can skip ahead to load one of these csv files.
 - Jupyter Noteboook containing all the code and analysis used in the project.
